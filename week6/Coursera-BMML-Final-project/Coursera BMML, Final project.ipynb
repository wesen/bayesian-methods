You start with a small number of random samples, say 5, and rank them according their similarity to your vision of Brad Pitt: 1 for the worst, 5 for the best. You then rate image by image using GPyOpt that works in a latent space of VAE. For the new image you need to somehow assign a real number that will show how good this image is.
